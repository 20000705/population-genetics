# Summary of Hardy-Weinberg Law

## 1.1: DNA Variation in Drosophila
This section focuses on genetic variation, primarily using Drosophila's alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene as an example. Kreitman’s 1983 study illustrated DNA sequence variation at the ADH locus, which was groundbreaking for understanding molecular evolution. By comparing different alleles from various regions, Kreitman found silent mutations (mutations that do not affect amino acid sequences) to be more prevalent than previously expected.

## 1.2: The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
The Hardy-Weinberg law provides the foundation for population genetics by predicting the genetic makeup of populations that are not evolving. The key equation for predicting genotype frequencies is:

$$
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
$$

Where:
- \( p \) = frequency of the dominant allele
- \( q \) = frequency of the recessive allele
- \( p^2 \) = frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype
- \( 2pq \) = frequency of the heterozygous genotype
- \( q^2 \) = frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype

If a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, allele frequencies do not change over time, given assumptions like random mating, no selection, no migration, and no mutation.

## 1.3: Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
When populations are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, it suggests that some evolutionary forces—like selection, genetic drift, or gene flow—are at play. These deviations allow researchers to study the genetic structure of populations and make inferences about evolutionary dynamics.
