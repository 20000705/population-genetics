# Summary of Hardy-Weinberg Law

## 1.1 DNA Variation in Drosophila
Population genetics studies genetic variation within species, which can now be easily analyzed using techniques like PCR and DNA sequencing. One classic study analyzed the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene in *Drosophila melanogaster*. The study found that there were 14 polymorphic sites within this gene, and most of these variations were silent (not affecting the protein function). Understanding this molecular variation is fundamental to population genetics.

## 1.2 Loci and Alleles
A **locus** refers to the position on a chromosome, while an **allele** is the specific form of a gene at that locus. Alleles can differ in several ways:
- **By origin**: alleles come from different chromosomes.
- **By state**: alleles differ in their genetic sequence.
- **By descent**: alleles come from different ancestral sources.

## 1.3 Genotype and Allele Frequencies
In population genetics, the structure of a population is described by the relative frequencies of genotypes and alleles. Given two alleles \(A1\) and \(A2\), the allele frequencies can be calculated as:

$$
p = \frac{2 \times \text{freq(A1A1)} + \text{freq(A1A2)}}{2 \times \text{population size}}
\]
\[
q = 1 - p
$$

## 1.4 Randomly Mating Populations
The **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium** describes how allele and genotype frequencies remain stable in a randomly mating population free of evolutionary forces:

$
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
$

Where:
- \( p^2 \) is the frequency of \( A1A1 \),
- \( 2pq \) is the frequency of \( A1A2 \),
- \( q^2 \) is the frequency of \( A2A2 \).

Random mating leads to genotype frequencies based solely on the allele frequencies.
